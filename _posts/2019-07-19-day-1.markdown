Hi! I'm Kari from Mexico City. I want to do the challenge of 100 days of code. I'd been programming in Java, but I want to learn Javascript. Why? I think that with Javascript you could do more things like apps, websites and even programs that are on a computer and easy to deploy.

My goals are:
- Build a web/app that generates passive income.
- Learn React and Vue
- Do a graphic with D3.js
- Do a Twitter Chatbot
- Give a tech talk
- Do at least one algorithm daily.

I'm working at the moment, so I will do a post weekly about what I learned. 

- 112 days 
- 16 weeks 
- 4 months

So thank you for joining me in my coding journey. This is day 1.

*See you next week!*
